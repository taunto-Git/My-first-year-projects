# check_value library:
that is a small but useful library that can shorten your code, instead of doing the usual cout/cin that can cause bugs if the user puts a different type of value with just one line you do all the three things but how exactly works?

there are 4 functions 
check_int() 
check_float()
check_double()
check_char()

so we are using the check_int() function as an example,and it starts with displaying the string variable (the cout) the enters a while loop and keeps repeating the cin>> until the user inserects a correct value

this is how it works from the outside, you give the return to a variable and inserect the message you want to display before reading as a parameter
